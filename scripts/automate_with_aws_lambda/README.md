This repository contains the code for a project to scrape all the articles on
Fangraphs and save them to an Amazon S3 bucket..

There are three files in the scripts directory:
1. a_scrape_articles.py
2. lambda_function.py
4. utils.py

The scripts are run daily using AWS Lambda.

Here is a link to my <a href="https://ericchan24.github.io/automation/cron/email/web%20scraping/2019/11/30/Keep-Up-With-the-News-Using-Python/" target="_blank">
blog post</a> about the project.
